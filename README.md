# FLAPPY-BIRD
It's a game I made in Android Studio using Java for a college project. Open to any suggestions and feedback, THANK YOU.

A game made in Android Studio, the player is a bird constantly falling in a single direction , there are obstacles that it has to avoid but at the same time not fall down. Includes 2D models and audio with a scoring system.

CONTROLS: TAP ON THE SCREEN TO AVOID FALLING DOWN.
